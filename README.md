# Social Network API

## Description
This project was made as part of an social networking application. The front-end design is not yet ready, but the back-end database with API routes has been prepared here, so the transition to a full website should be fairly smooth! The database stores information about users, their "thoughts" (short text posts), and other users' reactions to those posts.

## Installation
This application was built using basic Javascript, and the npms listed below. Insomnia was also used for ease of testing and querying the database, though it is not required for the project.

Required npms:
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

## Usage
To access the program via `localhost`, a connection to the server must be made using MongoDb. After installing the necessary npms and providing the database access criteria, the connection can be made using the terminal CLI by evoking `npm start`.
